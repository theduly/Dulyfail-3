The package includes:

- source code 
- windows wallet 
- linux wallet
- premine wallet (wallet.dat)
- logo

Block Explorer: http://80.208.227.23:3001/


Please notice that you might receive an error while opening the wallet for the first time: EXCEPTION: "stxxruntime_error", this happens because the wallet is compiled on a different computer. It's very common for wallet executables. In case it happens, just close the wallet and open it again to solve the problem.
